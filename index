# Atheme.org IRCv3 Working Group

The IRCv3 Working Group is a group of IRC client and server software authors working to
enhance, improve, maintain and standardize the current IRC protocol.  Logically, it is
an activity of [atheme.org](http://atheme.org) but represents the interests of many parties.

Other stakeholders in the IRC protocol, such as IRC networks and IRC network operators are
invited to participate.  If you would like to discuss IRCv3 standardization efforts over
IRC itself, you may find us at `irc.atheme.org #ircv3`.

The IRCv3 working group is incubated by [atheme.org](http://www.atheme.org).

# Specifications

Right now the IRCv3 specification is distributed as a series of extension specifications to
IRC protocol version 2.7, also known as [RFC1459](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1459).
To understand the basis of the IRC version 3 protocol, please read RFC1459 followed
by the extension specifications.  A unified specification draft is being worked on
which will replace RFC1459 at a later date.

Each version of IRCv3 contains base extensions, which comprise the core functionality
of the IRC version 3 client protocol, and optional extensions, which comprise
the extended functionality of the protocol.

## IRCv3.1

Current released version of IRC protocol is 3.1

### Base Extensions

 * [IRC Version 3.1: Capability Negotiation](/specification/capability-negotiation-3.1)

 * [IRC Version 3.1: `multi-prefix` Extension](/extensions/multi-prefix-3.1)

 * [IRC Version 3.1: `sasl` Extension](/extensions/sasl-3.1)

### Optional Extensions

## Next Version

Submit new extensions for consideration for 3.2!

The IRCv3 Working Group maintains a registry of "work-in-progress" extensions that have not yet
been accepted as part of an IRC protocol version.  IRC software vendors may provide additional
extensions that have not yet been added to this registry.  We recommend that extensions not in
the registry use appropriate namespacing as described in the capability negotiation specification
and in the message tags specification.

To submit an extension to the extension registry, please contact us via IRC for now
(`irc.atheme.org #ircv3`).  Extension specifications should be submitted in Markdown format.

### Base Extensions

 * [IRC Version 3.2: Message Tags](/specification/message-tags-3.2)

### Optional Extensions

 * [IRC Version 3.2: `server-time` Extension](/extensions/server-time-3.2)

 * [IRC Version 3.2: Metadata](/specification/metadata-3.2)
