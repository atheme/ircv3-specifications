# Client to client inquiries
 
## Introduction
 
Several of the existing messages sent by CTCP are inappropriate for transmission
using the [message intents] framework and a PRIVMSG, as they do not represent an
ordinary message and in some cases (such as TIME) if translated to use an intent
tag would give the peculiar case where the PRIVMSG has no actual message, all of
the information being carried in the intent tag.
 
This latter case, while not prohibited by RFC 1459, is nonetheless prohibited by
several major ircds.
 
## Capability
 
A client MUST request the `inquiry` capability in order to send or receive these
messages.
 
## INQUIRE
 
Represents an inquiry from one client to another. The format is as follows:
 
    INQUIRE <Target> <Command> [<argument>, ...]
 
Target identifies the entity being inquired of, while Command specifies the kind
of inquiry. Any arguments may be optional, depending on the command used.
 
## IQRESULT
 
Represents a response to a previous `INQUIRE`
 
    IQRESULT <Target> <Command> [<argument>, ...]
 
The target and command are the sender of the original INQUIRE and the original
command. The arguments are whatever response is appropriate for the command.
 
## Sending to channels

Clients may send INQUIRE messages with channels as the target, subject to normal
access control for the channel in question. Upon receiving such messages clients
should respond to the sender as normal.

Clients MUST NOT send IQRESULT messages to channels. Servers MUST respond to any
such messages with an ERR_CANNOTSENDTOCHAN numeric.

If the ircd implements a channel mode that blocks non-ACTION CTCP messages, that
mode MUST also block INQUIRE and IQRESULT.

## Known commands
 
Some existing CTCP commands don't belong here: ACTION modifies PRIVMSG and hence
is an intent on that message, while VERSION and USERINFO are metadata and should
be handled by that specification.
 
### TIME
 
Request the target's idea of the local time. The inquiry has no arguments, while
the result has one argument, the current time. There is no existing standard for
the representation of the time.
 
### PING
 
Requests a response. An argument is optional in the request, but if present, the
response must contain exactly the same arguments.
 
## Translation
 
Servers MUST translate INQUIRY and IQRESULT messages to CTCP if they are sent to
a client which has not enabled the `inquiry` capability. They MAY also translate
in the opposite direction for non-ACTION CTCP messages.
