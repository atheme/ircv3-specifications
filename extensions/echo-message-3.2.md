## Description

This client capability MUST be named `echo-message`.

If enabled, servers MUST send `PRIVMSG` and `NOTICE` messages back to
the client that sent them. If servers apply any modifications to these
messages, they MUST send the final version of the message back to the
originating client. Servers MUST NOT send `PRIVMSG` and `NOTICE`
messages back to the client when they send a message to themself.

For clients, receiving a message with themselves as the sender acts as
an acknowledgement that the message has been delivered to the server.
Clients that receive self-sent `PRIVMSG` and `NOTICE` messages, MUST
treat them the same way as if the client itself would have sent the
message to the target. Clients may choose to disable local echoing
of sent `PRIVMSG` and `NOTICE` messages altogether, or present them
in pending state.

## Use cases

The capability is useful for clients to get an acknowledgement that a
message was delivered. It can be also used for measuring lag between
client and server, that is, the time it takes from sending a message
to receiving it back.

Furthermore, the capability is useful for users that have multiple
clients attached to a bouncer. In this scenario, when users send
messages from one client, the messages get automatically relayed to
other attached clients. This allows all attached clients to display
full conversation.

## Examples

In the following examples, `example!ex@example.com` presents a client
that has enabled the `echo-message` capability.

    --> PRIVMSG Attila :hi
    :example!ex@example.com PRIVMSG Attila :hi

The client interprets the received message as if it had sent a `PRIVMSG`
with contents "hi" to `Attila`.

Another example where a server modifies a message by filtering out text
formatting and sends the final version back:

    --> PRIVMSG #ircv3 :back from \02lunch\0F
    :example!ex@example.com PRIVMSG #ircv3 :back from lunch


# Errata

* Previous versions of this specification did not describe what should
happen when a client sends a message to themself.
