## Introduction

The `chghost` client capability allows servers to directly inform clients about
clients changing their host or user without having to simulate the client
reconnecting. This is useful for servers implementing virtual hosts or masks
and helps reduce clutter on the client's UI.

## The `chghost` capability

When a client changes their user or host, servers MUST send the `CHGHOST`
message to clients who have enabled the `chghost` capability and either share
the same channel as the target client or have the client on a `MONITOR` list.
Servers SHOULD additionally send the `CHGHOST` message to the client whose
user or host has changed if the client supports the `chghost` capability.

When the capability is not enabled for other clients who share channels with or
monitor the changed client, servers SHOULD send messages to simulate the client
reconnecting. This allows clients to keep their user state up to date. For
shared channels, the simulated events SHOULD include appropriate `QUIT`, `JOIN`
and MODE commands, to restore membership and user channel modes. For monitored
clients, the events SHOULD include appropriate `RPL_MONOFFLINE` and
`RPL_MONONLINE` numerics.

When the server sends a `CHGHOST` message to a client, it MUST defer doing so
until both successful `NICK` and `USER` commands have been received by the
server.  The server MAY choose to defer it until after registration is
completed, for example if a valid SASL authentication during client
registration triggers an assignment of a virtual host. If the server does not
defer it until registration is completed, and either the user or the host of
the client changes, the server MUST send a new `CHGHOST` message.

## The `CHGHOST` message

The `CHGHOST` message is as follows:

    :nick!old_user@old_host.local CHGHOST new_user new_host.local

The `new-user` parameter represents the user's "username" or "ident" which may
or may not have changed in the CHGHOST process.

The `new_host.local` parameter represents the new hostname for the user which
may or may not have changed in the CHGHOST process.

Servers that implement ident checking might choose to prefix a username with a tilde `~` character to indicate missing confirmation from an ident server. This MUST be considered part of the username and included in any CHGHOST messages where relevant.

    :nick!~old_user@old_host.local CHGHOST ~new_user new_host.local

## Fallback for not supporting the `chghost` capability

    :nick!old_user@old_host.local QUIT :Changing hostname
    :nick!new_user@new_host.local JOIN #ircv3
    :ircd.local MODE #ircv3 +v :nick

## Examples

In this example, `tim!~toolshed@backyard` gets their username changed to `~b` and
their hostname changed to `ckyard`:

    :tim!~toolshed@backyard CHGHOST ~b ckyard

In this example, `tim!b@ckyard` gets their username changed to `toolshed` and
their hostname changed to `backyard`:

    :tim!b@ckyard CHGHOST toolshed backyard

## Errata

* Previous versions of this specification did not include any examples, which made
it unclear as to whether the de-facto `~` prefix should be included on CHGHOST
messages. The new examples make clear that it should be included.
* Previous versions of this specification did not specify that the `CHGHOST`
command should be sent after both a valid NICK and a valid USER command have
been received.
* Previous versions of this specification used confusing descriptions and have
since been rewritten to include a simpler description and example.
* Previous versions of this specification did not specify whether or not the
client whose user or host changed should receive the message.
