What IRCv3 Client Guaranteed Message Delivery attempts to solve
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Up to this day, IRC still doesn't offer guaranteed message delivery for PRIVMSG,
NOTICE, and what more?.  It will only give a notification when a message hasn't
actually reached its intented destination.

i.e. a user trying to send a message to a channel he isn't in, with a 'no
external messages' mode set on the channel, or a user trying to send a message
to an invalid destination

In both cases the server will respond with a numeric error message identifying
the original request. But in case the IRC message has actually reached its
desired destination, the client doesn't have any means to assert this condition,
and to take further actions from there.  More specifically, no programmatic
efforts can be made up from this point to account for the aforementioned
scenario.  In order to address this issue, a new standardized tag is suggested.

Standard Message Delivered Tag Specification
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The new tag will be a standardized one, and named "message-delivered", in short
"md", and will follow the rules as provided by the 'Message Tags' framework.

The tag will need to have a client generated ID as a value when added to the
message that will serve as an identification of the transmitted message, so that
the client can later on identify which messages the server acknowledges in the
subsequent server replies.

The server will only then acknowledge the client messages that have successfully
reached their desired target with no issues.  Otherwise, the server will
maintain its normal behavior for reporting error messages.  

i.e.
Client: @md=1 :nick!ident@host.com PRIVMSG recipient :Hello.  I now have the
capability to test if my IRC message will ever reach you.
Server: ACK 1

The client will then increment the counter each time it needs to send a message,
in order to identify them later on in the upcoming server replies.
