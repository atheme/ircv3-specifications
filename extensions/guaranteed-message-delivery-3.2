What IRCv3 Client Guaranteed Message Delivery attempts to solve
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Up to this day, IRC still doesn't offer guaranteed message delivery for
PRIVMSG, NOTICE, and what more?.  It will only give a notification when
a message hasn't actually reached its intented destination.

i.e. a user trying to send a message to a channel he isn't in, with a
'no external messages' mode set on the channel, or
     a user trying to send a message to an invalid destination

In both cases the server will respond with a numeric error message
identifying the original request. But in case the IRC message has
actually reached its desired destination, the client doesn't have any
means to assert this condition, and to take further actions from there.
More specifically, no programmatic efforts can be made up from this
point to account for the aforementioned scenario.

In order to address this issue, a new extension is suggested.

Guaranteed Message Delivery Client Capability Specification
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The new extension will be named "guaranteed-message-delivery", and will
follow the rules of the capability framework.

It basically extends PRIVMSG and NOTICE in the multiple recipients
part of the IRC message to add an integer as the last recipient in the
comma separated list of recipients, and that will serve as an ID of the
transmitted message.  The server will then only acknowledge the ID to
the client if it receives the message, and no errors occur in the normal
flow of the server's execution of the client command.

Client: PRIVMSG recipient,counter :Hello.  I now have the capability to
test if my IRC message will ever reach you.  Server: ACK counter

The client will then increment the counter each time it needs to send
a message, in order to identify them later on in the upcoming server
replies.
