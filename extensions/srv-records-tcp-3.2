=========================================

This specification defines the recommended behaviour of servers and
clients for using SRV records.

The SRV RR is defined in RFC 2782:
<https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2782>

Servers
-------
IRC servers that listen using the tcp protocol, SHOULD have a SRV
record for the domain name being advertised.

For example, an IRC server with the advertised domain name of
<irc.example.org> listening on 194 for irc, and 994 for ircs:

    _irc._tcp.irc.example.org    IN    SRV    0 5 194 irc.example.org
    _ircs._tcp.irc.example.org   IN    SRV    0 5 994 irc.example.org

When listening on multiple ports, a SRV record MUST be assigned for
each of these.

For example, the above IRC server also listening on 6667 for irc, and
6697 for ircs:

    _irc._tcp.irc.example.org    IN    SRV    0 5 194 irc.exapmle.org
    _irc._tcp.irc.example.org    IN    SRV    1 5 6667 irc.example.org
    _ircs._tcp.irc.example.org   IN    SRV    0 5 994 irc.example.org
    _ircs._tcp.irc.example.org   IN    SRV    1 5 6697 irc.example.org


Clients
-------

Clients that attempt to connect using the tcp protocol, SHOULD attempt
to look up the SRV record(s) of the domain name attempting to connect
to. The client MUST attempt to look up records for both irc and ircs
to define if the server supports connections for irc, ircs, or both.

If the name server returns valid SRV records, the client SHOULD
inform the user of

    a) whether the name server advertises support for irc, ircs or
       both
    b) the ports advertised by the name server for irc and/or ircs
