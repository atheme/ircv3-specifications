extended-validation nicknames for IRC

The `@ev` tag.
--------------

The `@ev` tag indicates whether or not the message comes from a source that is believed by
IRCD to be "trusted".  This is intentionally left up to the implementor, as there may be
multiple ways of establishing trust.

If the ev tag is present, it means that the message is "trusted."

An example of the `@ev` tag:

    @ev;account=Diablo-D3 :Diablo-D3!~pmcfarland@adterrasperaspera.com PRIVMSG #offtopic :I have a $10 million deposit pending on my ATM CARD from Nigeria, isn't that cool?

Altering the display of messages with the `@ev` tag.
----------------------------------------------------

We suggest that an IRC client which suppots the `@ev` tag renders the Nickname in green-on-white text,
to display that the highest trust level has been attained.

Messages without the `@ev` tag should not have any special visual feedback.
