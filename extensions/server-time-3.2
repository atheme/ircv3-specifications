Clients indicate support for the extension by requesting a capability server-time as per the [IRC Client Capabilities Extension][cap].

	CAP REQ :server-time

When enabled, the server-time extension enables optional `time` [message tag](/specification/message-tags-3.2) which can be used in messages from server to client.
The value of the tag has the following syntax:

	<value> ::= <A sequence of digits representing a Unix timestamp> '.' <3 digits representing number of milliseconds>

If the `time` is presented in a message received from server, client SHOULD treat the message as the one happened at the given time instead of now.

The timestamp is a Unix timestamp specifying the seconds since the epoch (1970-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 UTC), as specified by POSIX.1.
As explained there, this is NOT the actual number of seconds since that time since e.g. leap seconds are ignored and simplified rules for leap years are used.
See POSIX.1 Annex B 2.2.2.

Servers MAY include the timestamp in messages when they see fit (in order to tell the client that the message really happened at the given time instead of now),
but MUST NOT do so before acknowledging the client capability using `CAP ACK`.
Clients MAY choose to simplify parsing by accepting timestamps at any point in the connection (e.g. even before `CAP REQ`).

Example:

Angel messaged Wiz at Wed, 19 Oct 2011 16:40:51.620 UTC

	@time=1319042451.620 :Angel PRIVMSG Wiz :Hello
